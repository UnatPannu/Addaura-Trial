                <h3>I’m Marco Mannino, founder of Addaura Rec. </h3>
                <div class="hidden-content">
                    <p>Born and raised in Italy, travelled quite a lot. I started recruiting at 24 in Amsterdam, helping startups and tech companies find top engineering talent. I built and led the Nordics team at one of the world’s fastest-growing recruitment firms. <br/>
                        After years of working inside the system, I started Addaura Rec. to do things differently — with more focus, speed, and care.

                <h3>What Makes Addaura Different? </h3>
                <div class="hidden-content">
                    <p>Addaura isn’t your typical recruitment agency. It’s built on values that actually show up in the work:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Human-first: I work as a trusted partner — not a salesperson. No pressure, no scripts. Just honest conversations and solutions built around your goals.</li>
                            <li>Culture fit matters: I help you build your team your way — based on real alignment, not just job titles.</li>
                            <li>Transparency always: I give real feedback, admit when I don’t know something, and keep confidential searches truly confidential. No fluff. No faking.</li>
                            <li>Quality over quantity: You won’t get spammed with CVs. You’ll meet people who actually make sense — selected with care, industry insight, and precision.</li>
                            <li>No middle layers: You deal directly with me. Clear communication, full accountability, and nothing lost in translation.</li>
                            <li>Fair, flexible pricing: No bloated agency fees. My rates are realistic and shaped around the type of hire — whether it’s one role or a full project.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                <h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
                <div class="hidden-content">
                    <div class="card-section">
                    <p>I focus on Fintech, Greentech, and AI — where innovation moves fast. I help companies hire the right people, and candidates find the right roles. 
                    <br/>From sourcing to feedback, I handle everything personally. Most roles are filled in 1–2 weeks.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-section">
                    <p><b>What I do:</b>
                    Sourcing, process management, booking interviews, getting feedbacks, pitching role to candidates, advice on salary/tax perspectives/culture, offer negotiation, closing, after-placement catch-up.<br/>
                    </p>
                    <p><b>What I don’t do:</b>
                    Chasing a simple commission, obeying to stupid KPI’s, manipulating clients and candidates – and therefore, from YOUR client side, avoiding boring calls, aggressive communication, wasted money and talent not matching.<br/>
